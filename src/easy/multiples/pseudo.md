# Pseudo Code Solution

const arrayOfMultples = (first argument number , second argument multiples) => {

    create an empty array stored in multiplesArray variable



    for Loop
    (Initialisation - i is = number argument; condition - run the loop as long as i is less than or equal to number is true then times that by multiples; Increment - i equals i + number - this gives us the increment we want)

    push the i variable into the created multiplesArray

    return the array
}

call the function and store it in a variable so we can console log the result
